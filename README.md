# COP3503 Projects ðŸš€

This repository contains java projects for **COP3503** (Computer Science 2) at the **University of Central Florida**. It includes implementations of fundamental **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts** in **Java**.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects Overview

This repository includes the following Java projects:

- **CourseCombinations.java** (Combinatorics / Backtracking)  
  - Generates all possible course combinations based on predefined constraints.  
  - Useful for scheduling and permutation-based problem-solving.

- **GreedyRobots.java** (Greedy Algorithms / Optimization)  
  - Implements a greedy strategy to optimize movement and resource collection.  
  - Demonstrates the efficiency of greedy heuristics in decision-making problems.

- **ParenthesesCombinations.java** (Combinatorics / Backtracking)  
  - Generates valid parentheses combinations using recursive backtracking.  
  - Useful for parsing problems and expression validation.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
